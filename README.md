## final_project

### This project is aiming to explore possible causes for the different severity of COVID-19 pandemic between countries.

We consider people’s awareness and population density as possible factors and study whether they would affect the severity of pandemic between different countries.


To scale people’s awareness, we assume the search of keywords related to COVID-19 on Google as the degree of awareness.

The severity of pandemic is defined as the number of confirmed cases per million people.



### Hypothesis: 

1. For countries that people are aware of COVID-19 earlier,  the pandemic will be less serious.

2. Pandemic will be more serious in the countries with a higher population density.
